# Compilers and versions
The compilers selected for this study were:

- The official Lua compiler, covering versions from 5.3.0 to 5.4.7.
- The LuaJIT compiler, version 2.1.

# Benchmarks
As for the benchmarks themselves we adapted the suite provided by [LuaAOT](https://github.com/hugomg/lua-aot-5.4), which has been widely used in previous performance studies.

These were the selected benchmarks:

- Binary Trees
- Fannkuch
- Fasta
- Knucleotide
- Mandelbrot
- Nbody
- Spectralnorm

# Research details:
The machine used to perform this study had the following specifications:
- **Operating System:** macOS 15.3.2 (24D81) arm64
- **Kernel:** 24.3.0
- **CPU:** Apple M1
- **GPU:** Apple M1
- **RAM:** 16 GB
- **Host:** MacBookPro17,1
